# Film Club Bot

A simple bot to manage weekly activities for a film club group I run.

---

### Film Club Flow
- Each week, we choose a film to watch;
- At the end of the week, we gather to discuss the film;
- After the meeting, we select a new film for the following week;

And the cycle continues...

### Bot Functionality
I built this bot to handle some tasks to improve the group's quality of life.

#### 1. Film History Tracking
* The bot tracks which films we've watched and who has seen them, so members who miss a week or join later can catch up.

#### 2. Watch Status Tracking
* The bot keeps track of who has watched the current week's film and who hasn't. It sends daily reminders to those who haven't watched it yet.
